  ( Done with configurin docker-compose.yml file, then running docker compose up -d )  

* Run two containers: application + DB ( Can be seen in yaml.png )

* Provide credentials as environment variables, so DB image can be
  configured with custom credentials and application can connect to DB automatically ( Done )
